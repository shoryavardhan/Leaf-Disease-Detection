# THERE ARE THREE METHODS TO RUN THE CODE : 

## 1. SINGLE CODE TO RUN WITH GUI EXPERIENCE :
(This code is less accurate, because of lack of computation power) 
		 
	1. Run file "SuperCode_with_Gui.ipynb".
	2. A new window will appear.
	3. Enter the name of image to be checked.
	4. Press button "PreProcess" to extract its features.
	5. Press button "Identify" to identify the type of leaf.
	6. Press button "Predict" to predict the final answer.

## 2. SINGLE CODE TO RUN WITHOUT GUI EXPERIENCE :

	1. Run file "SuperCode_without_Gui.ipynb"
	2. Input the name of image to be checked.
	3. Final answer will appear as output to the last cell of code.

## 3. MULTIPLE CODES :
	
	1. Run file "Preprocessing_Final.ipynb".
	2. This will generate "train_features.csv"
	3. Use this .csv file to run file "Identification_Final.ipynb".
	4. Now run the file "Prediction_Final.ipynb"
	4. Final answer will appear as output to the last cell of code.
